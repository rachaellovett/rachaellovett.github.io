    <h1><i>Why I Love Chick-fil-A</i></h1>
	<p>Chick-fil-A is single-handledly the best restaurant I have ever encountered.  Their menu ranges from fried to grilled chicken, salads, and waffle fries.  Entrees include the classic chicken sandwich, grilled chicken sandwich, grilled chicken wrap, and salads.  Sides include fruit cup, waffle fries, or a fruit parfait.  They also have a range of deserts that include cookies, ice cream and brownies.</p>

	<h2>My Favorites</h2>
	<p>My favorite things at Chick-fil-A are a large Diet Coke and a grilled chicken wrap with avocado lime ranch dressing. This is called the number 8.  I can get this meal, with no fries, for $7.53.  I like to think I'm being healthy because it is grilled chicken and not fried.  However, the number one, The Original, is also one of my favorites.  Below is a list of my favorites 1-4 as well as a table comparing the calories between the wrap and the sandwich.

	<h3>Locations</h3>
	<p>In my hometown, Tifton, there is a Chick-fil-A one mile from my house.  In my current address, there is one less than .5 miles.  I go to this Chick-fil-A almost everyday.  Chick-fil-A is more popular in the south than in the north.  You can find a location in almost any town in Georgia.  In fact, there are three in Athens.</p>
